# LabWiki: Clinical Laboratory Management System
**LabWiki** is a web-based platform designed to optimize internal communication, centralize academic protocols, and standardize troubleshooting for clinical laboratory equipment.

## 🧪 The Problem
Clinical laboratories often face challenges with information fragmentation:
 -Protocol update are lost in emails or physical folders.
 -Troubleshooting knowledge is siloed among senior staff.
 -Academic material (Ateneos) is hard to access for new team members.

 ## 🚀Key Feature
 -Centralized Ateneo Repository: A real-Time Library for academic and procedural documents.
 -Equiptment Troubleshooting Guide: Quick access to manuals and common error solutions for soecific analyzers (Cobas, Vidas, Iris,etc.).
 -Rea-Time Synchronization: Powered by Firebase, ensuring all staff members see the latest updates instantly.
 -secure Authentication: Role-based access to protect sensitive laboratoy procedures.

 ## 🔮 Tech Stack
 -Frontend: React + TypesScript
 -Styling: TailwindCss + Bootstrap
 -Backend as a Service: Firebase(Firestore & Authentication)
 -Routing: React Router



#Future Roadmap
-Notifications for new protocol uploads
-image gallery for specific laboratory findings(microscopy)
-DarkMode
